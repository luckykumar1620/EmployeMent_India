# EmployeMent India  
### Worker Registration & Booking Platform

EmployeMent India is a **full-stack service platform** that connects **workers (service providers)** with **users (customers)**.  
Workers can register themselves on the platform, while users can browse, book, and manage worker services in a secure and structured way.

The system is built with a **scalable MERN-stack architecture** and supports **role-based access** for Users, Workers, and Admin.
